# AcroWorld App Style Guide

This document outlines the official style guide for the AcroWorld mobile application to ensure a consistent, professional, and intuitive user interface.

## 1. Color Palette

Colors are chosen to be clean, professional, and accessible. They create a clear visual hierarchy.

| Role                      | Hex       | Color                               | Usage                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accent**                | `#4CAF50` | <span style="color:#4CAF50">■</span> | For primary calls-to-action (e.g., "Book Now" buttons), highlights, and selected states (tabs, filters). |
| **Primary**               | `#2196F3` | <span style="color:#2196F3">■</span> | For secondary actions, links, and important informational icons.                                  |
| **Secondary**             | `#8BC34A` | <span style="color:#8BC34A">■</span> | For less critical buttons, secondary highlights, or success states.                               |
| **Background**            | `#F5F5F5` | <span style="color:#F5F5F5">■</span> | The main background color for all screens and pages.                                              |
| **Surface / Card**        | `#FFFFFF` | <span style="color:#FFFFFF">■</span> | Background for cards, modals, forms, and primary content areas to make them stand out.            |
| **Text (Primary)**        | `#424242` | <span style="color:#424242">■</span> | For all primary text content, including titles, body copy, and labels.                            |
| **Text (Secondary/Muted)**| `#9E9E9E` | <span style="color:#9E9E9E">■</span> | For subtitles, helper text, disabled states, and less important information.                      |
| **Borders / Dividers**    | `#E0E0E0` | <span style="color:#E0E0E0">■</span> | For subtle separation between elements, like card borders or dividers in lists.                   |

## 2. Typography

The app uses a clean, sans-serif font for readability. The type scale establishes a clear hierarchy for information.

*   **Display Large:** 24pt, Bold - For major screen titles.
*   **Display Medium:** 20pt, Bold - For section headers.
*   **Title Large:** 18pt, Semibold - For card titles and important labels.
*   **Body Large:** 16pt, Regular - For primary body text.
*   **Body Medium:** 14pt, Regular - For secondary text and descriptions.
*   **Label Small:** 12pt, Regular - For captions, metadata, and helper text.

## 3. Spacing & Layout

A consistent spacing system is used to create a balanced and organized layout. All spacing should be a multiple of 4px.

*   **Tiny (4px):** For tight spacing within components (e.g., between an icon and text).
*   **Small (8px):** For spacing between related elements within a component (e.g., items in a chip row).
*   **Medium (16px):** Standard padding for screen content and spacing between cards or sections.
*   **Large (24px):** For separating major layout blocks.
*   **Extra Large (32px):** For significant visual separation.

## 4. Corner Roundness (Border Radius)

Consistent corner rounding provides a soft and modern feel.

*   **Small Radius (4px):** For small components like chips or tags.
*   **Medium Radius (8px):** Standard radius for cards, buttons, and input fields.
*   **Large Radius (16px):** For larger components like modals or bottom sheets.
*   **Full Radius (Circular):** For avatars and floating action buttons.

## 5. Iconography

Icons should be simple, clear, and universally understood.

*   **Style:** Use a consistent icon set (e.g., Material Icons - Outlined).
*   **Size:**
    *   Standard: 24x24px
    *   Small: 18x18px
*   **Color:** Icons should use the **Text (Primary)** or **Text (Secondary/Muted)** colors unless they are part of an interactive element, in which case they can use the **Accent** or **Primary** color.
